MSc graduate in Electrical Engineering from NTU. I recently returned from Montreal after completing a research internship and attending EAG New York.

During my internship, I conducted research in medical AI, focusing on interpretable models. I worked on reinforcement learning to improve alignment in diffusion models for inverse problems.
